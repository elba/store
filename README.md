# `elba/store`

`elba/store` is the storage for the [elba package index](https://github.com/elba/index). If you'd like to publish a package, you may want to check [this issue](https://github.com/elba/index/issues/2).

> WARN: The merkle tree in this repo is unstable (may be forced pushed), so don't rely on it and you should always fetch package metadata from the index and retrieve via raw api.
